# Mission-to-Mars

## Purpose: 
The Mission to Mars analysis project scrapes data from multiple sources and displays it on a browser, allowing for information to be refreshed when new information is published. 

## Method: 
Using Splinter and Beautiful Soup, images and facts are scraped from two websites and displayed on a new site using Chrome Webdriver to pull the information into an html index file. The site can be updated using the refresh button on the web page. 

## Analysis: 
Scraping data from other sites allows the analyst to collect and store data regularly viewed for their research in one brower page.
